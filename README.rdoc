= simple_eav

== UPDATE
  Version 1.0.0, is only compatible with >= 3.1. If you are still bound to < 3.1 please use an older version of this gem.

simple_eav provides a more simple alternative to {acts_as_eav_model}[https://github.com/visfleet/acts_as_eav_model] that works with
ActiveRecord without any monkey patching.  This gem is designed to be a replacement for acts_as_eav_model.

Acts_as_eav_model's purpose is to provide a model with any number of custom attributes.  This project has the same purpose.  The difference being maintaining utmost compatibility with ActiveRecord::Base.

This library, to my knowledge, is fully compatible with acts_as_eav_model.  This update introduced the ability to specify custom attributes exactly the same as attributes with an actual column in the database ie:

  Person.create :attribute_with_column=>true, :attribute_without_column=>true

== Installation
  gem install simple_eav

== Usage
=== 1. Create the migration for your model

  create_table :people do |t|
    t.text  :custom_attributes # Name this column whatever you like just *make sure* it is a TEXT field
    ....
  end

=== 2. Configure simple_eav in your model

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    include SimpleEav

    configure_simple_eav :custom_attributes # This sets up the serialization for your custom attributes
  end

=== 3. Set and Get custom attributes as if they were a normal attribute on your model
  person = Person.new
  person.name = 'Joe'
  person.name ~> 'Joe'

  person = Person.new :name => 'Joe'
  person.save!
  person.name ~> 'Joe'

== Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a
  commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
